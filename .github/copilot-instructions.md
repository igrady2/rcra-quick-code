# Copilot Instructions for RCRA Quick Code & Labeler

## Project Overview
This project is named **RCRA Quick Code & Labeler**. The README does not provide details, so agents should expect to discover architecture and workflows by inspecting new files as they are added.

## Key Guidelines for AI Agents
- **File Discovery:** Start by listing and reading all files in the workspace to understand the project structure. The current workspace is nearly empty, so expect rapid evolution.
- **Documentation:** Always update the README and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with new conventions, workflows, or architectural decisions as they emerge.
- **Conventions:** Follow standard naming and organization unless project-specific patterns are documented in README or `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
- **Workflow:** If build, test, or run scripts are added, document their usage and any non-obvious commands here.
- **External Dependencies:** Document any integrations or dependencies as soon as they are introduced.
- **Examples:** When new components, services, or data flows are created, add concise examples to this file to guide future agents.

## Immediate Next Steps
- As the codebase grows, update this file to reflect:
  - Major components and their responsibilities
  - Developer workflows (build, test, debug)
  - Project-specific conventions
  - Integration points and external dependencies

## References
- See `README.md` for high-level project info (currently minimal).
- Update this file as soon as new patterns or conventions are established.
